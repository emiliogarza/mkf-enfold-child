# mkf-enfold-child
Child Theme of Enfold for MKF sites. Just versioning the components I've built into Enfold for the MKF projects here.

## Some Stuff it does
* We enqueue both the root avia-style theme styles and the css from this style.css file
* We load the custom shortcodes you can write.

## To-Do
* I'm not enqueing the custom-shortcode.js, I need to do that properly.
